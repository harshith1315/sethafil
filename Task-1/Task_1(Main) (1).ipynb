The overall trend shows a steady increase in dollar value over time, although the rate of this increase varies.  Initially, growth is slow and gradual from 1947 to approximately 1971, where the value remains below $2.  A period of more pronounced growth follows, becoming steeper around 1980.  Around the year 2000, the dollar value begins to increase more rapidly, exceeding $18. A noticeable fluctuation occurs between 2007 and 2010, where the value peaks around $27 before dipping to approximately $25, and then resuming its upward trajectory to finish above $31 in 2013.

            "The line graph, titled \"The Ups and Downs of Party Affiliation,\" displays the annual totals of registered voter party affiliation percentages from 1992 to 2012.  The data originates from the Pew Research Center and includes all registered voters interviewed each year. Three lines represent Democrats (dark blue), Independents (olive green), and Republicans (reddish-brown). Democrats began at roughly 36% in 1992, fluctuated between 34% and 37%, and ended around 35% in 2012. Independents started near 31% in 1992, generally trended downward, hitting a low point around 27% in 2002, then rose slightly to about 33% by 2012. Republicans began at approximately 29%, saw a slight peak around 32% in 2002 and 2004, but declined to around 28% by 2012.  Each data point on the lines represents the percentage for a given year, marked along the x-axis. The y-axis displays percentages from 10% to 50% in increments of 10.  The final values for 2012 are labeled directly on the graph: 35% for Democrats, 33% for Independents, and 28% for Republicans.\n"
